# Data Analytics and Visualization Projects

Welcome to my **Data Analytics and Visualization repository**, showcasing multiple projects implemented in Python using **pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and seaborn**. Each project focuses on solving real-world data problems through analysis, visualization, and insights.

---

## **Why this Repository?**

As an aspiring data analyst and data scientist, I created this repository to:

- Strengthen my fundamentals in **data analysis and visualization**.
- Practice solving diverse datasets and derive actionable insights.
- Showcase structured, production-ready notebooks for interviews and professional learning.

## **Tools & Libraries Used**

### **1. pandas**

- Powerful library for **data manipulation and analysis**.
- Provides `DataFrame` and `Series` data structures to read, clean, transform, and analyse data efficiently.
- Used here for:
  - Reading CSV datasets
  - Handling missing data
  - Grouping, merging, filtering data
  - Creating pivot tables and new engineered features

### **2. NumPy**

- Fundamental library for **numerical computations in Python**.
- Provides fast multi-dimensional array operations, linear algebra functions, and basic statistical operations.
- Used here alongside pandas for numerical calculations and efficient data processing.

### **3. Matplotlib**

- The **foundational plotting library in Python**.
- Allows creation of static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- Used here to plot:
  - Line plots for trends
  - Scatter plots for relationships
  - Bar plots for comparisons

### **4. Seaborn**

- Built on top of matplotlib with **more advanced statistical plotting features and beautiful default styles**.
- Used here for:
  - Enhanced plots with hue, style, and size aesthetics
  - Heatmaps for correlation analysis
  - Distribution plots for feature understanding

## **Projects in this Repository**

### ðŸ”» **1. [Global Health & Wealth Analysis](./Global_Health_Wealth_EDA)**

- **Objective:** Analyze life expectancy, GDP per capita, and population trends across countries and continents from 1952 to 2007.
- **Key Skills Demonstrated:**
  - Data cleaning, missing value analysis
  - Feature engineering (total GDP, GDP category, life stage)
  - Pivot tables, groupby analysis
  - Visualisation of trends and correlations
- **Outcome:** Derived insights to inform health and economic policy recommendations.
