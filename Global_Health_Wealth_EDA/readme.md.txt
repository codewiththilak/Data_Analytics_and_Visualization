# 🌎 Global Health & Wealth Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand the relationship between **GDP per capita, life expectancy, and population** across countries and continents over time. The analysis aims to derive meaningful insights for health and economic policy recommendations.

## 🎯 **Objective**

- Analyze global trends in life expectancy and GDP per capita from 1952 to 2007.
- Explore continent-wise disparities in health and wealth metrics.
- Derive actionable insights for developmental priorities.

## 🛠️ **Tools & Technologies Used**

- Python
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 **Key Steps**

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Checked data types, missing values, and duplicates.
2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created new columns for total GDP, GDP categories, and life stage classifications.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Visualised trends in life expectancy and GDP per capita.
   - Analyzed continent and country-wise statistics.
4. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Summarised key findings for policymakers.

## 📊 **Key Findings**

- **Positive correlation** between GDP per capita and life expectancy across countries.
- **Asia** shows rapid GDP growth but mixed life expectancy improvements.
- **Africa** has the lowest average GDP per capita and life expectancy, highlighting urgent developmental needs.

## 💡 **Recommendations**

1. **Investments in healthcare infrastructure** in low life expectancy regions.  
2. **Economic development programs** targeting GDP growth to indirectly improve life expectancy.  
3. **Further analysis** combining education and health expenditure data for causal insights.
